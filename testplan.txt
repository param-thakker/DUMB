In this assignment, we process the command input by the user in plain English and then transform it to the appropriate DUMB protocol command.
To test that our code was synchronized and that the server does not cause client threads to deadlock, we added mutex locks to some critical sections of our code
such as when create a message box, delete a message box or try to open a message box. We tested our code without mutexes
first by adding sleep() to test how commands entered by the clients at same time affect the protocol and if we got the desired output.
We found that the server crashes if we try to do multiple things at a time such as putting a message in a message box which is
being deleted by another client at the same time and many other scenarios like that. By using sleep() function in our code, 
we realized the critical sections of our code where we should use mutex_lock so that the server doesn't crash.

While solving the assignment, we found a flaw in the DUMB protocol. We saw that there was no error reported to the client when a client 
tries to open a message box which is already open by the same client. We therefore have added that functionality which will report 
ER:ONLY1 to the client when that scenario occurs.
